# Basic Calculator 🧮🤓👆

## Introduction
This calculator was built following Clear Code's tutorial [Introduction to GUIs in Python with PyQt5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jrEVihl-E4) on YouTube. But the project idea was taken from [florinpop17 github](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Calculator-App.md), definetly recommend checking it out.

> ### What it does now? 👨‍🔧
> Well, this calculator is very basic and can only multiply, divide, sum and subtract. However, it has many bugs. Which will be fixed.
