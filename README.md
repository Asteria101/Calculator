# Calculator :abacus:🤓👆

## Introduction
This calculator was built following Clear Code's tutorial [Introduction to GUIs in Python with PyQt5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jrEVihl-E4) on YouTube. But the project idea was taken from [florinpop17 github](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Calculator-App.md), definetly recommend checking it out.

> ### What it does now?
> Well, this calculator is very basic and can only multiply, divide, sum and subtract. However, it has many bugs. Which will be fixed.

### Prospects :bulb:	
:negative_squared_cross_mark: Fix Bugs ⚠️🐛
> - When '=' is pressed treat error;
> - When an operator is inserted at the end;

:negative_squared_cross_mark: Implement New Features :chart_with_upwards_trend:
> - Possibility to show a real number as a fraction or decimal;
> - Keep the last answer in a variable ```ANS```;
> - Button ```DEL``` for deleting the last digit or operator;
> - Button ```POW``` for power function;
> - Button  ```Log``` for logarithmic function;

:negative_squared_cross_mark: Linear Algebra Features [🔢]
> - Basic operations with matrices, such as sum, subtraction and multiplication. As well as, Gaussian Elimination.
> - Furthermore, solving linear systems.
